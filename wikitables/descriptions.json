On the other hand, the \"Adjacency matrix\" requires V^2 storage, while the \"Incidence matrix\" requires V * E storage. \n\nWhen it comes to time complexity, adding a vertex or an edge in both the \"Adjacency list\" and \"Incidence list\" representations takes constant time, O(1). However, adding a vertex in the \"Adjacency matrix\" representation takes V^2 time, while adding an edge in the \"Incidence matrix\" representation takes V * E time. \n\nRemoving a vertex or an edge in the \"Adjacency list\" and \"Incidence list\" representations takes E time. In contrast, removing a vertex in the \"Adjacency matrix\" representation takes V^2 time, while removing an edge in the \"Incidence matrix\" representation takes V * E time. \n\nFor the query of whether two vertices u and v are adjacent, assuming the storage positions for u and v are known, the \"Adjacency list\" representation takes V time, the \"Incidence list\" representation takes E time, the \"Adjacency matrix\" representation takes constant time, O(1), and the \"Incidence matrix\" representation takes E time. \n\nIn terms of remarks, it is noted that when removing edges or vertices, all vertices or edges need to be found in the \"Adjacency list\" and \"Incidence list\" representations. The \"Adjacency matrix\" representation is slow for adding or removing vertices because the matrix must be resized or copied.
