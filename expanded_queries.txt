This information is typically provided by game developers and publishers to help consumers make informed decisions about the appropriateness of a game for different age groups. The games age rating system takes into account factors such as the game's content, themes, violence, language, and sexual content, among others, to determine the appropriate age range. These ratings can range from "Everyone" or "E for Everyone" for games suitable for all ages, to "Mature" or "18+" for games intended for adult audiences only. The games age rating system is designed to ensure that games are played by individuals who are developmentally ready for the content and themes presented in the game.
